CV Management and Visualization Application
About the Project
This application is a powerful tool that enables users to upload, analyze, and interactively view the content of their CVs. It transforms traditional CVs into a digital web experience, offering job seekers and HR professionals the ability to review CVs in a more organized and effective manner.

Key Features
CV Upload: Users can easily upload their CVs. Supported formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) will be specified.

Automatic Sectioning: Uploaded CVs are automatically analyzed and divided into main sections such as "Personal Information," "Education," "Work Experience," and "Skills."

Interactive Viewing: Instead of viewing the entire CV as a single page, users can focus by selecting only the sections they wish to see (e.g., just "Work Experience").

Modern Interface: With a user-friendly and aesthetic web interface, CVs are visualized like a website.
